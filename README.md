# EHR Management System
## Semantic Interoperability

### Goal
With the development of the group work, it was intended that the group would apply the concepts and knowledge acquired during the theoretical and practical classes of the curricular unit. As a final result, it is expected the implementation of a system where Semantic Interoperability methods will be applied, in particular architectures based on Web services.

### Results
The implementation of the system was accompanied by a properly structured report which includes the decisions that were taken during the development of the project. It was important to clearly present the type of information that is possible to obtain, as well as the justification for the information flow of the developed system. Decisions regarding the choice of languages, methodologies and tools must be justified. The complexity of the system was studied, measuring execution times and in terms of future work, presenting proposals for improvements.

### Statement
**The present group chose the following theme: Electronic Health Records (EHR) management system based on the OpenEHR clinical model.**
